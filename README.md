# codecademy_javascript_syntax_i
 This is a repository for my Codecademy Learn JavaScript Syntax, Part I code that I want to save.

 I'm making this repository public so people can find it if they'd like to see what I've come up with for the various projects as part of the course.

 I generally hew pretty close to the instructions, but sometimes I'll put a little something different in. I'll comment what I'm up to and why.
